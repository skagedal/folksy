Folksy
======

Folksy is a framework for creating simple educational games that run
in the browser, on your mobile phone, or anywhere else where you have
a game engine that supports the simple format. At least that's the
idea. That's part of the idea.

The games have a basic simple form: presented with a *stimulus*, A --
an image or a sound, or both -- the user should respond with choosing
another stimulus, B, thus learning a relation between A and B.
