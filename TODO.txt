Folkes Folk - TO DO list
========================
Simon KÃ¥gedal Reimer <simon@kagedal.org>

.General 
* Clean separation of _game engine_, _games_ and _themes_
* Link to README from game; maybe a nice http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/[sticky footer]?
* Web application where you can design your own games 
* Nicer formatting of AsciiDoc generated html

.Game engine
* Force the kid to move the cursor away from letter between questions, like "click on me for next question"
* Allow use of keyboard
* Nice animated effects on correct answers, sound effect on wrong answer
* Versions with three or more letters. 
* Full alphabet version using Fish Eye!
* Mouse-over highlighting for letters
** Use jQuery's `mouseEnter`, `mouseLeave` events
** Set CSS element `cursor` to http://www.quirksmode.org/css/cursor.html[pointer].
* Android game engine
* iPhone/iPad game engine
* Separate _game logic_ in platform independent JavaScript! Can JavaScript be embedded in Android/iPhone apps?
* Using local or CDN hosted jQuery should maybe be a setting? The former can be good for debugging purposes.

.Game tool
* Written in Python
* Prepare games (JSON file + media) from YAML file (or from just a bunch of media files, Wikipedia page...)
* Use http://ffmpeg.org/[ffmpeg] for converting sound files (possibly using http://code.google.com/p/pyffmpeg/[PyFFmpeg], but shell call might be simpler)
* http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/[Python Imaging Library] for image info

.Data
* Record better sound
* General game sets, such as "A for apple, B for banana..." -- in English and Swedish.
