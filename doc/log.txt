I'm having trouble deciding what documentation system I should use. I
was going to go for JSDoc, but it doesn't seem to work well with the
module structure I like. Plus, I really want it to have some simple
markup like Markdown -- hate having to use html in comments. Looks
awful.

My favorite right now is http://pdoc.org/[PDoc]. One thing though.
I'm going to use Google Closure Compiler. This uses JSDoc fields for
guiding compilation. So maybe I'm stuck then..? :-(
